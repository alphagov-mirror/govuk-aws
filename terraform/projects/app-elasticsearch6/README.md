## Project: app-elasticsearch6

Managed Elasticsearch 6 cluster

This project has two gotchas, where we work around things terraform
doesn't support:

- Deploying the cluster across 3 availability zones: terraform has
  some built-in validation which rejects using 3 master nodes and 3
  data nodes across 3 availability zones.  To provision a new
  cluster, only use two of everything, then bump the numbers in the
  AWS console and in the terraform variables - it won't complain
  when you next plan.

  https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/issues/7504

- Configuring a snapshot repository: terraform doesn't support this,
  and as far as I can tell doesn't have any plans to.  There's a
  Python script in this directory which sets those up.
