 ## Project: artefact-bucket

This creates 3 S3 buckets:

artefact: The bucket that will hold the artefacts
artefact_access_logs: Bucket for logs to go to
artefact_replication_destination: Bucket in another region to replicate to

It creates two IAM roles:
artefact_writer: used by CI to write new artefacts, and deploy instances
to write to "deployed-to-environment" branches

artefact_reader: used by instances to fetch artefacts

This module creates the following.
     - AWS SNS topic
     - AWS S3 Bucket event
     - AWS S3 Bucket policy.
     - AWS Lambda function.
     - AWS SNS subscription
     - AWS IAM roles and polisis for SNS and Lambda.
