## Module: aws/alarms/ec2

This module creates the following CloudWatch alarms in the
AWS/EC2 namespace:

  - CPUUtilization greater than or equal to threshold threshold
  - StatusCheckFailed_Instance greater than or equal to 1 (instance status
    check failed)

Alarms are created for all the instances that belong to a given
autoscaling group name. All metrics are measured during a period of 60 seconds
and evaluated during 2 consecutive periods.

AWS/EC2 metrics reference:
