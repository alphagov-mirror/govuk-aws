## Modules: aws/alarms/natgateway

This module creates the following CloudWatch alarms in the
AWS/NATGateway namespace:

  - ErrorPortAllocation greater than or equal to threshold
  - PacketsDropCount greater than or equal to threshold

All metrics are measured during a period of 60 seconds and evaluated
during 5 consecutive periods.
