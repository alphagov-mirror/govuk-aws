## Modules: aws/alarms/rds

This module creates the following CloudWatch alarms in the
AWS/RDS namespace:

  - CPUUtilization greater than or equal to threshold
  - FreeableMemory less than threshold
  - FreeStorageSpace less than threshold
  - ReplicaLag greater than or equal to threshold

All metrics are measured during a period of 60 seconds and evaluated
during 2 consecutive periods.

For master instances, we should leave the ReplicaLag alarm disabled. To
disable the ReplicaLag alarm, set the `replicalag_threshold`
parameter to 0.

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| alarm\_actions | The list of actions to execute when this alarm transitions into an ALARM state. Each action is specified as an Amazon Resource Number (ARN). | list | n/a | yes |
| cpuutilization\_threshold | The value against which the CPUUtilization metric is compared, in percent. | string | `"80"` | no |
| db\_instance\_id | The ID of the database instance that we want to monitor. | string | n/a | yes |
| freeablememory\_threshold | The value against which the FreeableMemory metric is compared, in Bytes. | string | `"2147483648"` | no |
| freestoragespace\_threshold | The value against which the FreeStorageSpace metric is compared, in Bytes. | string | `"10737418240"` | no |
| name\_prefix | The alarm name prefix. | string | n/a | yes |
| replicalag\_threshold | The value against which the ReplicaLag metric is compared, in seconds. | string | `"0"` | no |

## Outputs
